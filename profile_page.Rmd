## Hello,

   my name is Mirko Miorelli and I am a PhD candidate at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/ "UBC Homepage") and a Research Assistant at [TRIUMF](http://www.triumf.ca/ "TRIUMF Homepage"). My field of study is theoretical nuclear physics and I work on ab initio nuclear structure calculations.
   
Besides physics, I am interested in scientific programming and machine learning. I love outdoors activity, photography and kayaking.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
