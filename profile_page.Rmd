## Hello,

   my name is Mirko Miorelli and I am a PhD candidate at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.phas.ubc.ca/ "UBC Homepage") and a Research Assistant at [TRIUMF](http://www.triumf.ca/ "TRIUMF Homepage"). My field of study is theoretical nuclear physics and I work on ab initio nuclear structure calculations.
   
Besides physics, I am interested in scientific programming and machine learning. I love outdoors activity, photography and kayaking.

Here it is a cool image of fractal noise I made:
